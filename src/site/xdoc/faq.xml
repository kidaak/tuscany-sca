			<ul>
				<li>
					Which other open source projects does Tuscany relate to?
				</li>
				<p>
					The Tuscany runtime is linked to the Apache Axis and Apache Tomcat runtimes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Eclipse SOA Tools Project provides tooling for SOA applications and it is
					based on the same Service Component Architecture specification that is used by
					the Tuscany runtime.					
				</p>

				<li>
					I get null pointer for all samples running Tomcat. What is wrong?
				</li>
				This is result of a user error but useful to know anyhow. The build/test instructions say that to run the helloworld tomcat test you go to testing/tomcat and run mvn. This works fine. 
				<br></br>If you forget this instruction and use the "prepareTomcat" ant target that the maven pom refers to, it fails.
