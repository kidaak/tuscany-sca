	<p>
		In addition to the Apache Tuscany projects which provide implementations of SDO and SCA for Java and
		for C++, there is an open source implementation of SDO for PHP hosted on the PECL site
		at <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/sdo"> http://pecl.php.net/package/sdo </a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is an overview of SDO for PHP at 
		<a href="http://www.zend.com/pecl/tutorials/sdo.php"> http://www.zend.com/pecl/tutorials/sdo.php </a>
		and you can find full documentation in the PHP Manual at
		<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.sdo.php"> http://php.net/manual/en/ref.sdo.php </a>.
