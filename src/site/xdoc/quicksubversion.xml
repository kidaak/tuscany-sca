	<p>
		You can download Subversion from 
                <script type="text/javascript">linkNewWindow('http://subversion.tigris.org/','http://subversion.tigris.org/');</script>.
	</p>

		Subversion Reference manual ("the book") is located at 
                <script type="text/javascript">linkNewWindow('http://svnbook.red-bean.com/','http://svnbook.red-bean.com/');</script>.

		If you use Eclipse as your development environment, there is a plugin available
		which enables you to use Subversion from within Eclipse (ie it is a Subversion
		client for Eclipse).  This plugin is called Subclipse and it is located at:
                <script type="text/javascript">linkNewWindow('http://subclipse.tigris.org/','http://subclipse.tigris.org/');</script>

		If you use Windows on your systems, there is also a graphical client implemented as an
			extension to the Windows shell, called TortoiseSVN:

					Common Commands for Subversion
			</span>
			<p>Create a directory called tuscany and check out the project.
				<p>
				<b style="">
					<i style="">To check out the Java project:</i>
				</b>
				</p>
			</p>
			<pre>
Committers:                        
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/java
Non-Commiters:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/java
			</pre>
			<p>
				<b style="">
					<i style="">To check out the C++ project:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>
Committers:                        
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/cpp
Non-Commiters:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/cpp
			</pre>
			<p>
				If it worked, you will see all the files as they
				checkout followed by a revision number - this is the
				version of the tree that you have (useful for comparing notes)
			</p>
			<p>
				<b style="">
					<i style="">
						To update your copy with other's people's committed changes:
					</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>
svn update
			</pre>
			<p>
				<b>
					<i>To manipulate files in various ways:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>
svn add

svn move

svn remove

svn diff
			</pre>
			<p>
				<b>
					<i>To commit changes go to the root and:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>
svn commit -m"change comment"
			</pre>
			<p>
				This will commit the entire tree and display the new
				revision number. You can also commit sub-trees and
				individual files but this is not normal.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>
					<i>To undo changes:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>svn revert ${file}</pre>
			<pre>svn revert -R ${directory}
			</pre>
			<p>
				<b>
					<i>To see what has changed locally:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>svn status</pre>
			<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
				<b>
					<i>Results:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				A means a file has been added locally
			</p>
			<p>
				D means a file has been deleted locally
			</p>
			<p>
				M means a file has been modified locally
			</p>
			<p>
				? means a file exists locally that is not being managed
				by svn.
				<span style="" />
				Typically this means you forgot to add it with
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">svn add</span>
				.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 1in;">
				! means a file that was being managed by svn no longer
				exists locally.
				<span style="" />
				Typically this means you didn't delete it using svn
				remove.
