		<section name="Creating and Submitting a Patch">
			Thank you for helping Tuscany project. Here are the steps to follow to create and submit a patch.
			<ul>
				<li>
				<p>
					<b> Check out the latest version </b> of source code from Subversion.
				If you have a version checked out already,
				do a fresh update before you make your changes. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You can find information about how to setup development environment <a href="projectjava.html"> for Java </a> or <a href="projectc++.html"> for C++ </a> here. 
			 	</p>
				</li>
			       
				<li> 
				<p>
					Please do a <b>full build with all tests enabled </b>. Try the following for Java projects:
			        </p><p> 
			        <code>
				 
					 maven -o clean new
				 </code>
			 	</p>
			 	</li>
			 
				<li>
				<p>
					 <b>Confirm</b> that the problem is actually fixed and include a test case in the patch where possible.
				 </p>
				 </li>
				 
				 <li>
				 <p>
					 <b>Generate a patch</b> by issuing the following command from tuscany directory.   
				 </p><p>
				 <code>
					 svn diff File >> patchfile
				 </code>
				 </p><p>
				  Please try to give your patch files meaningful names. This helps the developer
				  who applies a number of different patches. A recommendation is to use the JIRA 
				  issue number as part of patch file name. For example
			  	 </p>
			  	 <p> 
				 <code>
					  svn diff File >> File312
				  </code>
				  <br></br>
				  In this example, the number 312 is a JIRA issue number associated with this patch.
			         </p>
			        
			  	</li>
			
				<li> 
					<p> Add your patch file as an attachment to the JIRA issue that it is fixing.</p> 
				<p>
					Please include detailed steps to reproduce the problem in the issue description 
					so that the patch can be properly verified after it is applied.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Thank you! Your patch will be picked up for review. </p>
			</li>
		</ul>
