		<section name="The Tuscany Subversion Repository">
			<p>The Tuscany code is held in a Subversion repository.  Subversion is a code control
			system similar in function to CVS.  Subversion is used as the code repository by many
			Apache projects.  If you are not familiar with Subversion, see the 
			section <a href="getinvolved.html#Using Subversion">"Using Subversion"</a>.
			</p>
			<p>The Tuscany Subversion repository is found at 
			<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany">
			https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany</a>. You can check out the
			Tuscany code from the repository and build it on your own machine. 
			</p>
			<p>Inside the Tuscany repository, you will find two main directories containing code:
			<ul>
				<li>cpp - which holds the code for the C++ projects</li>
				<li>java - which holds the code for the Java projects</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
