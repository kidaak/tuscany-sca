		<h2>Apache Tuscany Downloads</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to the Apache Tuscany downloads site. As the Tuscany project is currently part
			of the Incubator, no binary downloads are available now.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to obtain the Tuscany runtime and tools, you should check out the source from the
			SVN repository and build it locally on your machine. 
			<br></br>
			Details of this can be found on the
			<a href="projectjava.html">java project</a> page for Java and on 
			<a href="projectc++.html"> C++ project </a> page for C++.
