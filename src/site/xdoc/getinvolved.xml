		<section name="Using Subversion (Command Line)">
			<p>
				You can download Subversion from 
                                    <script type="text/javascript">linkNewWindow('http://subversion.tigris.org/','http://subversion.tigris.org/');</script>.

			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-size: 10pt;">
					If you use Eclipse as your development environment, there is a plugin available
					which enables you to use Subversion from within Eclipse (ie it is a Subversion
					client for Eclipse).  This plugin is called Subclipse and it is located at:
                                    <script type="text/javascript">linkNewWindow('http://subclipse.tigris.org/','http://subclipse.tigris.org/');</script>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p style="margin-right: -0.25in;">
				<span style="font-size: 10pt;">
					If you use Windows on your systems, there is also a graphical client implemented as an
					extension to the Windows shell, called TortoiseSVN:
					<span style="" />
					http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/
				</span>
			</p>
			<span style="font-size: 14pt;">
					Common Commands for Subversion
			</span>
			<p>Create a directory called tuscany and check out the project.
				<p>
				<b style="">
					<i style="">To check out the Java project:</i>
				</b>
				</p>
			</p>
			<pre>
Committers:                        
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/java
Non-Commiters:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/java
			</pre>
			<p>
				<b style="">
					<i style="">To check out the C++ project:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>
Committers:                        
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/cpp
Non-Commiters:
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/cpp
			</pre>
			<p>
				If it worked, you will see all the files as they
				checkout followed by a revision number - this is the
				version of the tree that you have (useful for comparing notes)
			</p>
			<p>
				<b style="">
					<i style="">
						To update your copy with other's people's committed changes:
					</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>
svn update
			</pre>
			<p>
				<b>
					<i>To manipulate files in various ways:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>
svn add

svn move

svn remove

svn diff
			</pre>
			<p>
				<b>
					<i>To commit changes go to the root and:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>
svn commit -m"change comment"
			</pre>
			<p>
				This will commit the entire tree and display the new
				revision number. You can also commit sub-trees and
				individual files but this is not normal.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>
					<i>To undo changes:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>svn revert ${file}</pre>
			<pre>svn revert -R ${directory}
			</pre>
			<p>
				<b>
					<i>To see what has changed locally:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<pre>svn status</pre>
			<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
				<b>
					<i>Results:</i>
				</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				A means a file has been added locally
			</p>
			<p>
				D means a file has been deleted locally
			</p>
			<p>
				M means a file has been modified locally
			</p>
			<p>
				? means a file exists locally that is not being managed
				by svn.
				<span style="" />
				Typically this means you forgot to add it with
				<span style="font-family: Courier;">svn add</span>
				.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 1in;">
				! means a file that was being managed by svn no longer
				exists locally.
				<span style="" />
				Typically this means you didn't delete it using svn
				remove.

					Link to Eclipse download :

			</p>
			<p>
				To create the eclipse projects to use for SCA development:
			</p>
			<p>
				1) When checking code out from subversion, checkout the
					subversion trunk to a location outside your eclipse
					workspace (it has to be outside because Eclipse will
					not allow you to import projects from a location
					overlapping with your workspace)
			</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->
				2) Go to Import / Existing projects into workspace.
					<span style="" />
					Select either the runtime, spec, tools or samples
					directory.
					<span style="" />
					The wizard proposes the list of Eclipse projects
					under that directory. Importing the projects does
					not copy the files; it just makes the files at that
					location visible under an Eclipse project.
			</p>
			<p>
				3) If you need to use Eclipse to edit files outside of
					these projects (for example the etc directory, or
					the maven files at the root of the trunk), then
					delete the Eclipse projects, with the option to not
					delete the files, and import the whole trunk as a
					project.
			</p>

		<section name="Using Maven">
			<p>
				Tuscany uses Maven 2.x. Maven can be found here:
                    <script type="text/javascript">linkNewWindow('http://maven.apache.org/','http://maven.apache.org/');</script> 
			</p>
			<p>
				For some help getting started with Maven, look at:
                    <script type="text/javascript">linkNewWindow('http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html','http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html');</script> 
			</p>
			<!-- p>
                        THis was for maven 1.x
				There is a Maven plug-in for Eclipse called Mevenide which you can find here:
				<a href="http://mevenide.codehaus.org/download.html">
					http://mevenide.codehaus.org/download.html
				</a>
			</p -->
			<p>
				With Maven, there is no build "script" like the ant build.xml file. Instead you 
				provide Maven with a description of your project and it uses that information to
				determine how to achieve your build goal. The description is held in a pom.xml file.
				There is a pom.xml file at the top level of your project and there are subsidiary
				pom.xml files for modules within your project which are referenced from the top level
				pom file. The Maven project has also established a set of best practices for
				structuring builds and if you follow those you can get away with very little 
				description; the Tuscany builds are set up that way.
			</p>
			<p>
				The general rule for maven is that each (sub)project produces one build artifact 
				(typically a jar file). You can see this in the java project directory where
				there are separate projects for sca, sdo, das (etc) and within these, separate
				folders and pom files for major components such as container.java.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main Maven 2.x command is "mvn" and the default goal is "install" which will 
				compile, unit test and package each project. This will typically output a
				jar file that is installed locally so that other projects can depend on it.
			</p>
                        <p>
                            To build the Java project once you have Maven and Java SDK set up in your path, in the SVN checked out java directory:<br/>
                           <code>
                              mvn
                            </code>
