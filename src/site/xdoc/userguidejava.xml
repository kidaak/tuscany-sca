		<p>Apache Tuscany is built upon two core technologies, SCA and SDO.</p>
		<b>What is SCA?</b>
		<p>
			Service Component Architecture (SCA) is a specification which describes a model for 
			building applications and systems using a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  
			If you'd like to learn more about SCA you can read the 
			<a href="http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/specs/ws-sca/SCA_White_Paper1_09.pdf">white paper</a>.
		</p>

		<b>What is SDO?</b>
		<p>
			Service Data Objects (SDO) is an architecture and API which provides uniform access #
			to and manipulation of data from heterogeneous data sources, such as relational databases, 
			XML, and Web services. You can read the 
			<a href="http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/specs/ws-sdo/SDO_Specification_Java_V2.01.pdf">
			SDO Specification for Java</a> to learn more about SDO.
