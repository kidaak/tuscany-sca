            <p>There are a number of tools associated with Tuscany that are used at build time rather than runtime. 
Primarily these are concerned with generating infrastructure code based on interface definitions in order to ease
the load of the developer and ensure that Tuscany runtimes can host the business logic without the developer have to write to 
Tuscany APIs</p>
