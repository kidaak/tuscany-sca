Services are used to publish services provided by implementations, so that they are addressable by other components.
</p>
<p>
A service published by a composite can be provided by a service of a component defined in the composite, or it can be provided by a reference defined by the composite. The latter case allows the republication of a reference with a new address and/or new bindings.
</p>
<p>
A service may specify a binding. See the section on Bindings for more details of bindings.
