<p>
SCA references within an implementation represent links to services that the implementation uses that must be provided by other components in the SCA system.  For a composite, references of components within the composite may be wired to references of the composite, indicating that those references must be resolved by services outside the composite. 
</p>
<p>
References use bindings to describe the access methods used to invoke the services. See the section on Bindings for more details of bindings.
