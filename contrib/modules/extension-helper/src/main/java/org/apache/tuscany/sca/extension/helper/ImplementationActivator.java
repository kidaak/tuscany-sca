/**
 * An ImplementationActivator adds an SCA implementation type to the Tuscany runtime.
 * 
 * The SCDL XML used for the implementation is derived from the name of the
 * class returned from the getImplementationClass method - the package name and
 * any trailing "Implementation" string is removed, leading upper case characters
 * are converted to lowercase, and the suffix "implementation." is added. For 
 * example if getImplementationClass returns a class named "mypkg.FooImplementation"
 * then the SCDL for the implementation will be <implementation.foo>.
 * 
 * Attributes of the <implementation.foo> SCDL are based on the getters/setters of
 * the Implementation class. So if FooImplementation had getBar/setBar then there
 * would be an attribute name 'bar', for example, <implementation.foo bar="xxx">. 
 * 
 * BindingActivator implementations may use constructor arguments to have 
 * Tuscany ExtensionPointRegistry objects passed in on their constructor.
 * For example:
 * 
 *    public class MyImplementationActivator implements ImplementationActivator {
 *       ServletHost servletHost;
 *       public MyImplementationActivator(ServletHost servletHost) {
 *          this.servletHost = servletHost;
 *       }
 *       ...
 *    }
 *    
 * ImplementationActivator implementations are discovered by the Tuscany runtime
 * using the J2SE jar file extensions for service provider discovery. All
 * that means is packaging the new binding type in a jar which contains a  
 * file META-INF/services/org.apache.tuscany.sca.extension.helper.ImplementationActivator and
 * that file lists the ImplementationActivator implementation class name.
