Implementation POJO Sample
==========================
This sample demonstrates how new implementation types are constructed for 
Apache Tuscany SCA. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

Sample Overview
---------------
This sample contains a POJO implementation type as an example of how to create
new implementation types.

implementation-pojo-extension/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        pojo/                  - implementation model interfaces
          impl/                - implementations of the model interfaces
          provider/            - runtime implementation
      resources/
        META-INF/
          services/            - declares the extension
    test/
      java/
        helloworld/
          HelloWorldTestCase.java - JUnit test case
      resources/
        helloworld.composite   - the SCA assembly used during unit testing

  build.xml                    - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                      - the Maven build file
  
Building The Sample Extension Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample extension can be built using Ant as 
follows

cd implementation-pojo-extension
ant compile

Building The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built 
using Maven as follows. 

cd implementation-pojo-extension
mvn

Maven will also test that the sample extension built properly. You should see 
the following output from the test phase.

Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

This shows that the Junit test cases have run successfully.
