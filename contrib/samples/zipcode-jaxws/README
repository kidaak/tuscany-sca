ZipCode JAX-WS Sample
======================================
This sample demonstrates how to access an existing web service using JAX-WS/JAXB generated java interfaces/classes.

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you just want to run it to see what happens open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and do:

ant run

OR if you don't have ant, on Windows do

java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-zipcode-jaxws.jar zipcode.ZipCodeClient

and on *nix do

java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-zipcode-jaxws.jar zipcode.ZipCodeClient


Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a single component exposing a Web resource.

zipcode-jaxws/
  src/
    main/
      java/

      resources/
        ZipCode.composite                 - the SCA assembly for this sample
  zipcode-jaxws.png                       - a pictorial representation of the 
                                            sample .composite file
  build.xml                               - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                                 - the Maven build file        


Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant using the 
following commands

cd zipcode-jaxws
ant compile
ant run

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] 14-Jan-2008 14:28:07 org.apache.tuscany.sca.http.jetty.JettyServer a
ddServletMapping
     [java] INFO: Added Servlet mapping: http://L3AW203:8080/myWeb/*
     [java] Sample server started (press enter to shutdown)
     [java]
     [java] To get the Web resource, point your Web browser to the following add
ress:
     [java] http://localhost:8080/myWeb/index.html
     [java]
     
As this point the Web resource is exposed by a web server started automatically
by the SCA runtime. To stop the server just press enter.

Building The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built using
Maven as follows.

cd zipcode-jaxws
mvn
