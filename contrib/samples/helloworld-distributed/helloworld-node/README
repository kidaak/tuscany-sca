Distributed Helloworld Sample
=============================

This sample demonstrates a distributed SCA domain using the JMS implementation of binding.sca which
automatically discovers available nodes and the services they contain.

In this sample there are two nodes in the domain, a standalone node containing a Helloworld component,
and a webapp using a JSP with <implementation.web> which invokes the Helloworld service in the domain.

To run the sample:

- Build the two sample modules with mvn or Ant.
- Deploy the helloworld-webapp war to Tomcat. 
- Start the standalone node by:
  in the helloworld-node folder do "mvn dependency:copy-dependencies" then:
  java -Djava.ext.dirs=target\dependency -jar target\dependency\tuscany-node-dynamic-1.4-SNAPSHOT.jar target\sample-helloworld-node.jar

- On a web browser go to:
  http://localhost:8080/sample-helloworld-webapp

You should see "Hello world" returned on the web page and the node console should show "HelloworldImpl.sayHello: world"
