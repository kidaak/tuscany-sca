A dummy file that causes the target/classes/wsdl dir to be created in the generated test project. This is 
required because the test generator must run in the process-resource phase, after generate.xml has been copied
into target. The generator needs to write out target/classes/wsdl and will fail the directory isn't there. So
this file just gets unpacked and forces the directory to be created.
