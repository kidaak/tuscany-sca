/**
 * A test case designed to test the implementation of References from a Spring application
 * context, where the references are implicit, through the presence of Bean properties with a
 * ref attribute which is not satisfied by a Bean within the application context.
 *
 * The artifacts involved in this test are:
 *
 * 1) A composite containing a component with a Spring implementation which makes
 * a reference to a second component
 * 2) The composite has a component with a Java POJO implementation which satisfies the reference
 * 3) The <implementation.spring.../> element references an application context that
 * does not use an explicit sca:reference element to identify the reference made by the
 * Spring application, but relies on an unsatisfied Bean property with a ref attribute.
