/**
 *
 * Factory class for PropertyValueObjects for Spring implementations
 *
 * 6th May 2007: Chosen a very simple design for this class - since Spring implementations are a form
 * of Java POJO, the simple design chosen for this class is to re-use the PropertyValueObjectFactory
 * implementation from the base implementation-java-runtime package of Tuscany SCA Java, since the
 * same properties are going to be rendered in the same way to simple Tuscany POJOs and to Spring
 * Bean POJOs.  Mike Edwards
 * @version $Rev: 511195 $ $Date: 2007-02-24 02:29:46 +0000 (Sat, 24 Feb 2007) $
