/**
 * Representation of the type of data associated with an operation. Data is
 * represented in two forms: the physical form used by the runtime and a logical
 * form used by the assembly. The physical form is a Java Type because the
 * runtime is written in Java. This may be the same form used by the application
 * but it may not; for example, an application that is performing stream
 * processing may want a physical form such as an
 * {@link java.io.InputStream InputStream} to semantially operate on application
 * data such as a purchase order. The logical description is that used by the
 * assembly model and is an identifier into some well-known type space; examples
 * may be a Java type represented by its Class or an XML type represented by its
 * QName. Every data type may also contain metadata describing the expected
 * data; for example, it could specify a preferred data binding technology or
 * the size of a typical instance.
