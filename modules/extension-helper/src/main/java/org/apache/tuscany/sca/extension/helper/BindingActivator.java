/**
 * A BindingActivator adds an SCA binding type to the Tuscany runtime.
 * 
 * The SCDL XML used for the binding is derived from the name of the
 * class returned from the getBindingClass method - the package name and
 * any trailing "Binding" string is removed, leading upper case characters
 * are converted to lowercase, and the suffix "binding." is added.
 * For example if getBindingClass returns a class named "mypkg.FooBinding"
 * then the SCDL for the binding will be <binding.foo>.
 * 
 * Attributes of the <binding.foo> SCDL are based on the getters/setters of
 * the binding class. So if FooBinding had getBar/setBar then there
 * would be an attribute name 'bar', for example, <binding.foo bar="xxx">. 
 * 
 * BindingActivator implementations may use constructor arguments to have 
 * Tuscany ExtensionPointRegistry objects passed in on their constructor.
 * For example:
 * 
 *    public class MyBindingActivator implements BindingActivator {
 *       ServletHost servletHost;
 *       public MyBindingActivator(ServletHost servletHost) {
 *          this.servletHost = servletHost;
 *       }
 *       ...
 *    }
 *    
 * BindingActivator implementations are discovered by the Tuscany runtime
 * using the J2SE jar file extensions for service provider discovery. All
 * that means is packaging the new binding type in a jar which contains a  
 * file META-INF/services/org.apache.tuscany.sca.extension.helper.BindingActivator and
 * that file lists the BindingActivator implementation class name.
