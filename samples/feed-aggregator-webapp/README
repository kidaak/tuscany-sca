Feed Aggregator Sample
======================================
This sample demonstrates using the Feed binding to aggregator ATOM and RSS
and publish a new aggregated feed.

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you just want to run it to see what happens open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and do:

ant run

OR if you don't have ant, on Windows do

java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-feed-aggregator.jar feed.SampleServer

and on *nix do

java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-feed-aggregator.jar feed.SampleServer

Now the server is started you can point your Web browser to the URL of the
aggregated feeds.

Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a single component exposing a Web resource.

web-resource/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        feed/
          FeedAggregatorImpl.java         - implementation of the Feed
                                            aggregator component
          SampleServer.java               - starts the SCA Runtime and 
                                            publishes the aggregated feeds
      resources/
        FeedAggregator.composite          - the SCA assembly for this sample
  feed-aggregator.png                     - a pictorial representation of the 
                                            sample .composite file
  build.xml                               - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                                 - the Maven build file        

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant using the 
following commands

cd feed-aggregator
ant compile
ant run

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
    [java] Added Servlet mapping: http://localhost:8083/rssAggregator
    [java] Added Servlet mapping: http://localhost:8083/atomAggregator/*
    [java] Sample Feed server started (press enter to shutdown)

    [java] To read the aggregated feeds, point your Web browser to the following addresses:
    [java] http://localhost:8083/atomAggregator
    [java] http://localhost:8083/atomAggregator/atomsvc (for the Atom service document)
    [java] http://localhost:8083/rssAggregator
    [java] http://localhost:8083/atomAggregator?feedType=rss_2.0
    [java] http://localhost:8083/rssAggregator?feedType=atom_1.0
     
As this point the aggregated Feeds are exposed by a web server started
automatically by the SCA runtime. To stop the server just press enter.

Building The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built using
Maven as follows.

cd feed-aggregator
mvn
