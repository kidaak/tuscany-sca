Spring Bigbank Sample
=================
This sample implements a simple a version of the BigBank scenrio used in 
various places in the SCA specification documents. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

If you just want to run it to see what happens open a command prompt, navigate
to this sample directory and do:

ant run

OR if you don't have ant, on Windows do

java -cp ..\..\lib\tuscany-sca-manifest.jar;target\sample-simple-bigbank-spring.jar bigbank.client.BigBankClient

and on *nix do

java -cp ../../lib/tuscany-sca-manifest.jar:target/sample-simple-bigbank-spring.jar bigbank.client.BigBankClient


Sample Overview
---------------
The sample provides a composite with two java components wired together 
with a default binding. A request to the AccountComponent results in a 
request to the AccountDataComponent to get account data. The data returns 
back via the AccountComponent to the client.

Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample can be built and run using Ant as 
follows

cd simple-bigbank-spring
ant compile
ant run

You should see the following output from the run target.

run:
     [java] Account summary: currency: USD, [ID:Foo_CHA12345, balance:1500.0, ID
:Foo_SAA12345, balance:1500.0, ID:Foo_STA12345, symbol:IBM, quantity:100]

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd simple-bigbank-spring
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.
