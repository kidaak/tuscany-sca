<h2>Tuscany Hello World Axis Service Sample</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Tuscany hello world Axis service sample uses the code
generated in the&nbsp;<a href="../helloworldaxis/readme.htm" target="_blank">hello world Axis sample</a>. This
project just includes a standard J2EE web.xml and uses Maven's war
plugin to build a J2EE war that can be deployed into a web server.
&nbsp;Note that &nbsp;the configuring of the web application
server for Tuscany makes the Axis services available to all deployed web
applications, so it's not required to add Axis jars specifically to
this web application. </p>


<h3>Setup</h3>Set up your server as described in the <a href="../readme.htm#Tomcat_Setup" target="_blank">Tomcat Setup</a>. &nbsp;If you are not configuring with the acceptance test the server, you will need to add <span style="font-weight: bold;">tuscany-samples-helloworldws-service.war</span> to your tomcat's webapp directory.<br><br>Review Axis documentation on configuring and deploying web services.
<ol>

</ol>

<h3>Running</h3>

This service can be invoked by either the Tuscany SCA <a target="_blank" href="../helloworldwsclient/readme.htm">helloworldwsclient</a> sample or <a href="../helloworldaxis/readme.htm" target="_blank">hello
world Axis sample's</a> client &nbsp;sample.
<h3>Understanding the code</h3>

Review Axis documentation on developing web services.
