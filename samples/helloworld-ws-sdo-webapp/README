Hello World Web Service SDO WebApp Sample
=========================================
This sample demonstrates an SCA web service binding which works with
SDO and runs as a web application.  

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there
first.

As this sample provides a web app there is a manual step where the WAR file
that contains the sample is copied to your web app container. If you just want
to give this sample a go deploy the WAR file (target/sample-helloworld-ws-sdo-webapp.war)
to you web application server.

Once the web app is deployed use your browser to visit the following URL;

   http://localhost:8080/sample-helloworld-ws-sdo-webapp

The port and hostname will of course vary depending on your local installation.

The resulting web page displayed should show:

   Hello John Smith, Jane Doe!


Building And Running The Sample Using Maven
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run
using Maven as follows. When using Maven you don't need to run the helloworld-
ws-service sample first as Maven does this for you.

cd helloworld-ws-sdo-webapp
mvn

That should end with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" and create the target/sample-helloworld-ws-sdo-webapp.war
which you can copy to your server.
