    <p>
    This page uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Google Guice</a>.
    There is a service interface called <code>IMyService</code>, with an implementation POJO called <code>MyService</code>.
    Guice is used to wire the implementation into the <code>Page</code> using an <code>@Inject</code> annotation. You can use this
    annotation on the fields of any <code>Component</code> subclass.    
    </p>
    <p>
    The value of the <code>Label</code> component below will be updated with the return value from one of the service's methods when you click the link.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <blockquote>
    Value: <b wicket:id="message" id="message">Message goes here</b>
    <br />
    To update the label above, <a href="#" wicket:id="link">click here</a>.
    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <p>
    The wicket-guice project will take care of proxying the injected beans so that your pages can be serialized safely.
    To configure your application for Guice injection, see the javadoc for <code>GuiceComponentInjector</code>.
    </p>
