Implementation POJO Sample
==========================
This sample demonstrates how to use the new implementation type
implementation-pojo. 

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 

Sample Overview
---------------
This sample contains a POJO implementation type as an example of how to create
new implementation types.

implementation-pojo-extension/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        helloworld/            - client application artifacts
      resources/
        helloworld.composite   - the SCA assembly used during unit testing

    test/
      java/
        helloworld/
          HelloWorldTestCase.java - JUnit test case

  build.xml                    - the Ant build file
  pom.xml                      - the Maven build file
  
Building And Running The Sample Using Ant
-----------------------------------------
With the binary distribution the sample extension can be built using Ant as 
follows

cd implementation-pojo
ant compile
ant run

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built 
using Maven as follows. 

cd implementation-pojo
mvn

Maven will also test that the sample extension built properly. You should see 
the following output from the test phase.
