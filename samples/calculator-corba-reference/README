Calculator CORBA Reference Sample
===============================

This sample illustrates the use of Tuscany CORBA Binding to call reference 
services that are hosted as CORBA services.  

The README in the samples directory (the directory above this) provides 
general instructions about building and running samples. Take a look there 
first. 


Sample Overview
---------------
This sample extends the calculator sample by replacing the local wired 
connections with CORBA bindings. Instead of local add, subtract, multiply and 
divide components, an CORBA service implementation now provides the
add, subtract, multiply and divide interfaces and is hosted as an CORBA object. 
References specified in the .composite file include a CORBA binding which targets
this CORBA object. Name service which is used in CORBA communication is provided 
in test case class - CalculatorCORBAReferenceTestCase.java.

This sample adds a number of classes to the basic calculator sample:

calculator-corba-reference/
  src/
    main/
      java/
        calculator/
          CalculatorService.java  - as calculator sample
          AddService.java         - as calculator sample
          SubtractService.java    - as calculator sample
          MultipleService.java    - as calculator sample
          DivideService.java      - as calculator sample
          CalculatorClient.java   - as calculator sample
          CalculatorServiceImpl.java - calls the CORBA service
                                    that provides the target for the 
                                    CORBA bindings in the composite 
      resources/
        CalculatorCORBAReference.composite - the SCA assembly for this sample

          CalculatorCORBAServant.java - CORBA service implementation
          idl/                        - contains files generated 
                                        from  IDL file. Files are 
                                        used to create  CORBA object which
                                        will be consumed by SCA reference.

        CalculatorCORBA.idl      - IDL description for CORBA object
  pom.xml                         - the Maven build file   
  
Note. As this test creates and uses local network connections you may need to 
configure your firewall, if you are running one, to allow the test to run
successfully.         

Building And Running The Sample Using Maven 
-------------------------------------------
With either the binary or source distributions the sample can be built and run 
using Maven as follows. 

cd calculator-corba-reference
mvn

You should see the following output from the test phase.

Running calculator.CalculatorCORBAReferenceTestCase
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5.308 sec

Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

This shows that the Junit test cases have run successfully.
