<body>

If this sample is working correctly you should see "Hello World" on the next line...
<p>
<%= helloWorldService.sayHello("world") %>
<p>
If you do not see "Hello World" on the line above then there has been a problem.
<p>
The sample requires JMS resources be manually configured in the server environment, these are:
a JMS connection factory named "ConnectionFactory", and a destination queues named "HelloWorldService".
See the sample README file for more information.
