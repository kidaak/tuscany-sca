Website for the Tuscany project being incubated at Apache.
==========================================================

Website Howto
=============

The website is generated by Anakia.

The source documents are in the "site-author" directory.
The documents to publish are in the "site-publish" directory.

Editing the site
----------------

If you don't want to RTFM and just patch the website a little:

  -> edit/add files in the site-author/ directory (copy-pasting from existing
     files is often a good idea)
  -> install a java runtime environment or development kit
  -> type './build.sh' on linux/mac/solaris/unix or 'build.bat' on windows

you can now browse the site locally from the site-publish directory. Once you are
happy with your changes:

  -> manually 'svn add' any files generated in site-publish that weren't there
     before, or set the 'svn:ignore' property to ignore them. Eg something like
     
     svn status site-publish | egrep '^\?' | sed -e 's/^\? *//g' | xargs svn add
    
     may work for you.
  -> check the generated stuff looks like you want it to. Eg something like
  
     svn status site-publish | egrep '^(A|M)' | sed -e 's/^[AM] *//g' | xargs open
     
     may work for you.
  -> commit.
 

Editing Images
--------------
The programs you will need to edit all the files used on the site are:
1: Inkscape(http://www.inkscape.org/)- Open source vector graphics editor, used for all of the diagrams and a few layout components.
2: The GIMP(http://www.gimp.org/)- Open source bitmap graphics editor, used for most of the site layout components.

The original sources for most of the images are in the "image-sources" folder. You should be able to edit these files
and export them to the site-author folder so they will be copied over when the site is built.


Publishing the site
-------------------

The published version of the site lives in the site-publish directory in SVN.
To make this live, it must first be exported to a staging location on
people.apache.org and from there it will be replicated to the live servers.
This replication can take up to four hours so be patient.

To update the site:
  -> log into people.apache.org
     $ cd /www/incubator.apache.org/tuscany
     $ svn update

and wait ...
