BigBank
======

This application comprises three modules that represent the different aspects 
of a fictitious banking application. To run the sample you need to run each of 
the modules sample servers. This will bring up a Tuscany runtime, load the 
application and make the application's services available. You will need both
ant and maven installed to run these applications.

Bigbank-calculator

A calculator application, based on the calculator-script sample that uses a 
variety of languages to implement a calculator, which the banking application 
uses for simple value multiplication. To run the service do the following:

cd bigbank-calculator
Ant run

Bigbank-stockquote

A very simple web services based stock quote application which returns random 
stock quotes on request.

cd bigbank-stockquote
Ant run

Bigbank-account 
  
The front end of this demo application this module provides a web app for 
retrieving account information. It makes calls out to the stockquote and 
calculator applications to satisfy account requests. See the README in this 
module for further instructions.

cd bigbank-account
mvn -f pom-runapp.xml

Maven is used in this last step as there are unresolved issues with running
this app from the provided ant file. 

To try the app out point you browser at:

http://localhost:8082/WebResourceComponent/AccountJSON.html

This should display an interface with a single button that goes and retrieves 
a single set of account details exercising services across the three running 
SCA applications.
