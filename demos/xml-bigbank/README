This demo showcases the integration with XML technolgies in the service assembly.

Note: To build the project with maven or other IDEs, please download the WSDL from http://www.swanandmokashi.com/HomePage/WebServices/StockQuotes.asmx?WSDL and save the file as src/main/resources/wsdl/StockQuotes.wsdl.

Note: The live stock quote web service is not always running. Sometimes empty response is returned and the stock value is 0.
