	    compile and run each sample as though the user were running
	    samples from the binary distribution. Here we use ant targets
	    in the first instance but for some tests we may want to run 
	    jars directly or fire up webapp containers and deploy wars. In other cases
	    we may need to run two samples together to provide reference and 
	    service sides of the sample.
