The bin folder contains bat and shell scripts to help with using Tuscany. 
You can use the "tuscany.bat" script to start a standalone runtime and 
deploy your SCA contributions.

For example, change to the implementation-java-calculator sample included 
in the Tuscany distribution and enter the following command:

..\..\bin\tuscany.bat target\implementation-java-calculator.jar

The script also supports things such as using a Java remote debugger, 
for help enter use the "/?" parameter, eg:

..\..\bin\tuscany.bat /?

To simplify the use of the script add the absolute file path of the bin 
folder to your environment path:

set PATH=%PATH%;\Tuscany\tuscany-sca-2.0-M1\bin

and that enables running the script by just "tuscany", for example, in the 
implementation-java-calculator sample again you can enter:

tuscany target\implementation-java-calculator.jar

Tuscany developers may find it useful to add the script from their SVN checkout 
development build to their environment so as to start runtimes using their local
trunk build, for example: 

set PATH=%PATH%;\Tuscany\SVN\trunk\distribution\all\target\apache-tuscany-sca-all-2.0-SNAPSHOT-dir\tuscany-sca-2.0-SNAPSHOT\bin
