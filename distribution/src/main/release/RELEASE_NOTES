Apache Tuscany SCA 0.99 (incubating) August 2007 Release Notes
==============================================================

Apache Tuscany provides a runtime based on the Service Component
Architecture. SCA is a set of specifications aimed at simplifying SOA
Application Development which are being standardized at OASIS as part
of Open Composite Services Architecture (Open CSA).

Overview
--------

        This 0.99 release of Apache Tuscany SCA is expected to be
        the last point release before 1.0 final release. It further
        builds on the stability and modularity established with the
        previous releases including more complete implementation of SCA
        specifications, support for distributed SCA domains, SCA policy,
        OSGi implementation types, and notification components for pub/sub
        interactions. Start up time and memory footprint of the Tuscany SCA 
        runtime has also been reduced.

See the CHANGES file for a detailed list of the features in this release.
