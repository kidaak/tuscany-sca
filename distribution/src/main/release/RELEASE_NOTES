Apache Tuscany provides a runtime based on the Service Component
Architecture. SCA is a set of specifications aimed at simplifying SOA
Application Development which are being standardized at OASIS as part
of Open Composite Services Architecture (Open CSA).

Overview

     The Apache Tuscany SCA 1.0 release includes implementations of the
     main SCA specifications including:

        SCA Assembly Model 
        SCA Policy Framework 
        SCA Java Common Annotations and APIs 
        SCA Java Component Implementation
        SCA Spring Component Implementation
        SCA BPEL Client and Implementation
        SCA Web Services Binding 
        SCA EJB Session Bean Binding

    It also includes implementations of many features not yet defined
    by SCA specifications, including:

        - SCA bindings for Direct Web Remoting, RSS and ATOM Feeds, 
          HTTP resources, JSON-RPC, PUB/SUB Notifications, and RMI.
        - SCA implementation types for OSGI, XQuery, and various 
          dynamic languages including Groovy, Javascript, Python and Ruby
        - There are databindings for Service Data Objects (SDO), JAXB, 
          XmlBeans, and Axis2's Axiom

    Tuscany SCA supports running standalone with Jetty or Tomcat based runtimes
    or running as a standard web application. The runtime can be configured as 
    a single node SCA domain or with nodes distributed across multiple instances.
