Changes With Apache Tuscany SCA 1.0 (incubating) September 2007 
===============================================================

- Tuscany Java SCA now implements V1.0 of the core SCA 
  specifications
        SCA Assembly Model V1.0
        SCA Java Common Annotations and APIs V1.0
        SCA Java Component Implementation V1.0
        SCA Web Services Binding V1.0
  Including callbacks, conversations and callable references
  

- Support for ws-security configurable in the web services binding
  thro Tuscany SCA policy intents and policysets using the policy framework 
  introduced in the last release.  
  
  Note : This release supports specifications of policies around axis2
         config params - see helloworld-ws-service-secure sample.  The policy
         intents that have been tested are authentication, integrity and 
         confidentiality.  
         There is no sample or test that exercises confidentiality since there
         are some unresolved licensing issue around bouncycastle libraries.  
         However, users who are not encumbered by the bouncycastle license 
         restrictions can try the 'confidentiality' intent. See FAQ - 
         http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany/tuscany-sca-java-faq.html
                
         This release does not include support for WS-Policy
         attachments in Tuscany Policysets for ws-security.
         
  
- An XQuery component implementation type 
        implementation-xquery
        

- A Databinding for converting data to and from nodes for XQuery 
  processing
        databinding-saxon
        

- OSGI support has been extended to allow Tuscany contributions 
  packaged as OSGI bundles hence taking advantage of OSGI's bundle
  loading an dependency management capabilities 
  

- A BPEL component implementation type experimental implementation
based on SCA BPEL Client and Implementation V1.0. At the moment only
supports BPEL process as services.
	implementation-bpel


- The distributed runtime implementation has been separated out 
  into 
        *) domain
        *) node
  It is now wrapped by a SCADomain interface as is the standalone 
  runtime.
  
  Note: This release does not include support for WebApp host deployment 
        for a distributed SCA Domain 
  


- The web service binding will now generate WSDL automatically
  based on the service interface if no WSDL is provided
  

- A new "store" sample and associated document show how a 
  simple store front application can be constructed 
        samples/store
        
- The following features of this release are still experimental:
     - BPEL implementation type, integrating with Apache ODE
     - OSGI implementation type, integrating with Apache Felix
     - XQuery implementation type

 

Changes With Apache Tuscany SCA 0.99 (incubating) August 2007 
=============================================================

The following are the significant additions to release 0.99 
over and above all of what was offered in release 0.91.

- A version of the default sca binding that works between
  components runing in separate Java virtual machines
       binding-sca-axis

- A simple node implementation and a service discovery 
  function for running sca applications distributed 
  across more than one node
       distributed
       distributed-impl 

- integration with OSGi runtimes is now supported with
  a new implementation-osgi component type

- PUB/SUB interactions are now supported by using new 
  notification binding and implementation types, and
  samples demonstrating the feature.

- The Tuscany runtime now has a policy framework supporting
  the SCA policy specification

- the endpoint URIs used by SCA bindings has been rationalized 
  and now follows the SCA Assembly specification

- binding-ajax has been renamed to binding-dwr
