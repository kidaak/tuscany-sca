Changes With Apache Tuscany SCA 1.0 (incubating) September 2007 
===============================================================

- Tuscany Java SCA now implements V1.0 of the core SCA 
  specifications
        SCA Assembly Model V1.0
        SCA Java Common Annotations and APIs V1.0
        SCA Java Component Implementation V1.0
        SCA Web Services Binding V1.0
  Including callbacks, conversations and callable references
  

- Support for ws-security configurable in the web services binding
  thro Tuscany SCA policy intents and policysets using the policy framework 
  introduced in the last release.  
  
  Note : This release supports specifications of policies around axis2
         config params - see helloworld-ws-service-secure sample.  The policy
         intents that have been tested are authentication, integrity and 
         confidentiality.  
         There is no sample or test that exercises confidentiality since there
         are some unresolved licensing issue around bouncycastle libraries.  
         However, users who are not encumbered by the bouncycastle license 
         restrictions can try the 'confidentiality' intent. See FAQ - 
         http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany/tuscany-sca-java-faq.html
                
         This release does not include support for WS-Policy
         attachments in Tuscany Policysets for ws-security.
         
  
- An XQuery component implementation type 
        implementation-xquery
        

- A Databinding for converting data to and from nodes for XQuery 
  processing
        databinding-saxon
        

- OSGI support has been extended to allow Tuscany contributions 
  packaged as OSGI bundles hence taking advantage of OSGI's bundle
  loading an dependency management capabilities 
  

- A BPEL component implementation type experimental implementation
based on SCA BPEL Client and Implementation V1.0. At the moment only
supports BPEL process as services.
	implementation-bpel


- The distributed runtime implementation has been separated out 
  into 
        *) domain
        *) node
  It is now wrapped by a SCADomain interface as is the standalone 
  runtime.
  
  Note: This release does not include support for WebApp host deployment 
        for a distributed SCA Domain 
  


- The web service binding will now generate WSDL automatically
  based on the service interface if no WSDL is provided
  

- A new "store" sample and associated document show how a 
  simple store front application can be constructed 
        samples/store
        
- The following features of this release are still experimental:
     - BPEL implementation type, integrating with Apache ODE
     - OSGI implementation type, integrating with Apache Felix
     - XQuery implementation type
